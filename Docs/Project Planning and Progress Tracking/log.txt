## Itr 1 Summary

### Big Design Decisions
- We decided to begin building out the UI's with Java.swing as opposed to JavaFx. More team members were familiar with it so it would be quicker to begin development. Having to install an additional package as opposed to using the built in java.swing, was another consideration.
- In order to develop the UI, we went with a model with components and Views. The views display the GUI while the components make up the view. This sort of separation of concerns made development much easier.

### Concerns/Obstacles
- Since every member has varying levels of knowledge on git and github, some basic operations needed a bit more explanation. 

### User Stories
1. Create Home Class (Sarah)
Dev Tasks..
- Create the container class. A container represents a pantry/fridge of items that users can add and delete from. 
- Create Home and ContainerView, using java.swing to develop the UI.
- Setup the home to receive user input (name of container to be created).
- Create stub db class. 

Estimated Working time: 2 Days
Actual Working time: 7 Days
- Setting up this user story took longer than estimated. It also served as the foundation for other user stories as there must be consistent logic for setting up the UI and data binding.


2. Add Items Class (Nina)
Dev Tasks..
- Create item class to represent a food added to a user's pantry.
- Setup the AddItemPanel view to receive user input. 
- Implement error handling on user input.
- Populate stub db with items. 
- Test implementation of adding an item

Estimated Working time: 2 Days
Actual Working time: 3 Days

3. Remove Item from Pantry (Michel)
Dev Tasks...
- Create DeleteItemView to prompt user for the item they want to remove from their pantry.
- Implement error handling on user input to ensure that items actually exist in the database.
- Test implementation of deleting an item 

Estimated Working time: 2 Days
Actual Working time: 3 Days
 
4. Tagging Food Groups (Edison)
Dev Tasks...
- Create tag class and several "tag" classes.
- Implement tagging test cases 

Estimated Working time: 2 Days
Actual Working time: 1 Days

5. See Full List of items (Allen)
Dev Tasks...
- Create ItemsList view to display list of items 
- Display this view over top the containerView

Estimated Working time: 2 Days
Actual Working time: 1 Days

6. Add User (Ning)
Dev Tasks...
- Setup user class to implement user logins in future iterations

Estimated Working time: 2 Days
Actual Working time: 1 Days
